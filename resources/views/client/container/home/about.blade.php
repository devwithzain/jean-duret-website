      <p class="text-white text-xl font-normal leading-normal tracking-normal">Hello, my name is Jean Robert Duret, and
         I'm the Chief Executive Officer of Divine Solution Funding. I started this
         business venture with a few close counterparts to ensure one thing-bringing quality service to those looking to
         fund
         investments or buy and sell properties in a way that reflects core values and a customer first mindset. Divine
         Solution
         Funding's goals are not just to provide loans but to fund the dream lifestyle of our clients in a way that
         works for
         them whether commercial or residential.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white text-xl font-normal leading-normal tracking-normal">Conventional lending process can be
         tedious, over baring , and end still resulting in a lack of success due to credit
         checks and multiple other factors. That is what motivates us to be the community first lenders and realtors
         that work
         for you regardless of qualification! We provide private money loans with swift turnaround times,
         eliminate the need for credit checks, and ensure speedy closings, enabling you to access the capital you
         require
         promptly.
      </p>
